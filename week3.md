# Awesome Inc U Web Dev Bootcamp Week 3 👨‍💻 

BAM 💥 Another week in the books. The main concepts to learn this week were more abstract than week's past. But I handled
it as well as I could in my opinion! I was able to complete the majority of the Mindreader project before demo have it
working and the other projects. The topics we covered this week in regards to JS were JSON, Data Structures, Bootstrap, Atomic Design,
and state. All of these concepts combined together can create some creative mobile repsonsive sites, and we are just scratching the 
surface. 🤓

One thing that held me back this week was being almost embarassed to ask for help. It's probably more of a pride thing than anything. 
I've always wanted to get things the first try and I guess look like I have it all together when that definitely hasn't always
been the case. Also, since we aren't exactly in a normal classroom setting it's not as easy to ask questions in a traditional classroom
setting. We can send questions through the slack channel, but am I asking the right question? Am I being specific enough? Can 
I just find my answer if I look through Google more? And worst of all, is it a *dumb* question? 🤦‍♂️ I just need to learn to humble myself and ask 
questions when I get stuck on problems for extended periods of time. We are ***ALL*** here to learn together. If all of us 
are too scared to ask questions, we maybe won't learn as much as we could have. Fail *fast*, Fail *often*, and fail ***FORWARD***
💪💯🔥

We also talked about our *why*. Why are we taking on this challenge. Why are we sacrificing 14 weeks of our lives to change careers 
into the tech industry? Why did we quit our jobs? Why are we taking on the stress of learning all these technologies in a short amount
of time? For me, it's simple. I am doing this because I love programming, I love being a problem solver and solving problems for
people. I love creating solutions, especially at the flick of my fingertips tapping on a keyboard. I am doing this to hopefully land 
a dream job that I enjoy waking up and doing everyday. But ***above all***, I am doing this for
my wife and our beautiful daughter. They will be the first why for anything I do. I want to be able to spend more time with them, provide 
better for them, and just be better. This bootcamp will let me do that and am grateful for the opportunity.
