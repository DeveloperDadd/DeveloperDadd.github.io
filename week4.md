# Awesome Inc Web Deb Bootcamp Week 4 üë®‚Äçüíª

This week was *tough*. üí™ We took a deeper dive into JavaScript and are using Axios to fetch data from the backend to update the UI. The main project we had this week is building a simple weather app üå¶Ô∏è where users can input any 
desired zipcode and click a button for the UI to display the city, temperature, and an image matching the condition. *My* code was buggy and still is buggy, something about the function I wrote is not working properly and 
I am puzzled looking at my computer screen trying to figure out what it is. It's 11:30pm as I'm typing this, and I needed a break from looking for missing semi-colons. 

Last week at retro, our instructors gave us a little bit of motivation to do better at asking questions and practice pseudocoding a lot more before we even *think* about getting to the code. As junior programmers in a remote
environment, we are **ALL** so eager to get into VSCode and sandbox until we've solved the problem. We've all come from a traditional learning environment of meeting as soon as we can deadlines and doing anything possible to
meet those deadlines, if not be the first one to submit it. ‚è∞ But, that isn't how you learn, and in the programming world it certainly doesn't help. I spent a lot of time at the beginning of this week pseudocoding my weather app.
I declared my variables, thought through functions, what order they should be called, what conditions need to be checked, etc. Good pseudocode can translate to an easy process when it's actually time to code. 

Even though my code is buggy and I'm still working on it after demo day, I can say that the actual time I spent coding compared to the previous week was a lot less. üíØ I feel the only change I have to make on my backlog to get
this weather app deployed is very minor and sure one of my instructors can point it out in a heart beat. But that's ok, and that's part of the process of failing forward. Asking questions, consistently learning, and pseudocoding
effectively are all traits of a good programmer. But what does it mean to develop good code? ü§î In my personal opinion and from topics we've covered, good code should be easy to read and maintain for other programmers. 
It shouldn't be repetitive and developers should want to develop an app with as little lines of code as possible. Doing this may require more learning, or using abstract concepts to ship a satisfying result to the end user.
Good developers take their time and check their work, they enjoy taking the time to solve difficult problems for people, but also understand the importance of deadlines. They collaborate effectively, but are also able to stand on their own. 
Above all, they are always looking to hone their skill and sharpen their sword. I've seen so many programmers on LinkedIn and other social sites say they are lifelong learners and that is a common trait I see in a lot of 
successful devs. Cheers to the great developers ü•Ç May our paths cross soon and maybe we can learn from one another.
