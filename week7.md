#Awesome Inc Web Dev Bootcamp Week 7 👨‍💻

## Similarities and Differences between JS and Python 🐍💻

**Similarities:**
- Syntax Clarity
- Versatility: Both Python and JavaScript can be used for a wide range of applications
- Interpreted Languages: Both Python and JavaScript are interpreted languages

**Differences:**
- Scoping: JavaScript uses function scope, while Python uses block scope. 
- Indentation: Python enforces indentation for code blocks, which can be a significant change for someone coming from JavaScript, where indentation is not mandatory.

## Starting with Python Instead of JavaScript 🐍🌟

If I had started with Python instead of JavaScript at the bootcamp, the experience might have been a bit different. Python's cleaner syntax could have helped me grasp fundamental programming concepts more quickly. 
However, I might have missed out on the insights into asynchronous programming and DOM manipulation that JavaScript offers.

Python's strong emphasis on readability and simplicity would have provided me with a solid foundation, which would be valuable in any programming journey. 
However, starting with JavaScript has also given me a broader perspective on web development and allowed me to understand both front-end and back-end aspects better.

## Understanding Database Structure and Building Tech Projects 💾🛠️

As a coding bootcamp student, I can start to see under the hood of a how a project like a social media platform would work. For such a project, the database structure would likely involve tables for users, posts, comments,
likes, and relationships between users (friendships or followers). **Similar to a project we did call SQL Heroes where the superheroes could see each other's rivals, allys, powers, etc**

Throughout the bootcamp, I've gained a better understanding of how the backend works. Although I am very much still learning, this knowledge is equipping me with skills to build more complex tech-based tools in the future.

I can definitely see myself enjoying the process of building such projects in the future. But there is still much to learn! There's a sense of satisfaction in creating something functional and useful.
Building tech projects like this would be a great way to apply my Python and JavaScript knowledge while continuously learning and improving my coding skills. 🚀
