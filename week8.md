# Awesome Week Dev Bootcamp Week 8 üë®‚Äçüíª

During my coding bootcamp journey, I've delved into an extensive tech stack of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Django, and Python. Among these components, I've found Django to be particularly challenging.

Django, a Python web framework, offers robust features for web development, but its complexity has proven to be a roadblock. From creating models and views to managing databases, 
the difficulties of Django have at times felt overwhelming. Integrating the frontend, built with React, with the backend in Django has been a notable struggle.

## Learning from Others

As I grapple with these challenges, I've sought insights from professionals during our Bootcamp's lunch and learn sessions. 
Locally, companies like AwesomeTech, known for innovative web applications, could offer valuable perspectives on frontend-backend integration and Django experiences. 
Additionally, hearing from experienced Django developers associated with the Django Software Foundation or DjangoCon would be enlightening, providing guidance through their expertise.

## Overcoming Hurdles

Reconnecting my React-based restaurant frontend with the Django-powered backend was a significant hurdle. Debugging APIs, ensuring endpoint compatibility, and addressing CORS issues were obstacles I tackled. 
The moment when data finally flowed seamlessly from frontend to backend brought a sense of accomplishment.

However, it's important to acknowledge moments of struggle, such as dealing with configuration mismatches and errors. Support from my classmates, and guidance from my instructors 
played a pivotal role in overcoming these roadblocks.
