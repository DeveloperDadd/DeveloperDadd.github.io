# Awesome Inc Web Dev Bootcamp Week 9 üë®‚Äçüíª

## Reflection on the Past 8 Weeks of Learning

## HTML and CSS
Starting with HTML and CSS felt was a bit easier since I had some prior experience in this, but mastering CSS layout and animations will be something I'll need to tackle in the future. 
Aligning elements and replicating designs feels like solving a puzzle sometimes.

## Bootstrap
Bootstrap brought convenience with ready-made components, but customization challenges emerged. Overriding styles for uniqueness felt limiting.

## JavaScript
JavaScript's syntax was manageable, yet async programming and closures were hurdles. Debugging became routine, and DOM manipulation felt error-prone.

## React
Excitement for React's component-based architecture was hindered by a steep learning curve. State management complexities and inter-component data flow were overwhelming.

## Python and Django
Python and Django provided relief with clean syntax and conventions. Transitioning from JavaScript was confusing, but understanding models, views, and templates grew over time.

## REST API
Learning REST API implementation in Django was like learning a new language. Serializers, views, and routing complexities added to the challenge.

In retrospect, the past 8 weeks have been a roller coaster.
Yet, small victories like functional web pages and API responses kept me going.

The struggles are stepping stones to mastery. Fail fast, fail often, and fail forward üí™
