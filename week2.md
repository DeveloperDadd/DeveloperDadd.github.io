# Awesome Inc U Web Dev Bootcamp Week 2 👨‍💻 #

**WOW!** 💥💥💥 This week was *a lot* to take especially for week two. We definitely ramped up the difficulty this week and delved deeper
into the subjects covered in week one. 💯 Those topics being HTML, CSS, and *especially* JavaScript. For those unfamiliar with coding; HTML
represents the structure of the webpage or application, CSS is the design of the application, and JavaScript contains mainly the functionality
of the app. When all three languages are combined together, it brings the application together as a whole to hopefully create a pleasing
experience for the end user. 💪

HTML and CSS, while *a lot* to take in, are definitely easier to learn than JavaScript. But a weapon 🔫 that was added to our arsenal this week
to assist with the JavaScript portion of web apps is ***pseudocoding***.Pseudocoding essentially is taking the idea of a web app and 
translating it into plain english *beforehand* to make the coding portion much easier. If the developer takes time to think all the way through
a web application in pseudocode, they can finish the JavaScript portion much more efficiently. So what kinds of things should you be putting in
your pdseudocode? Define your variables, think about the functions that need to be invoked, the order in which they will run, etc. While 
pseudocode should be coded in large part ***before*** creating the app, you should always revisit your pseudocode throughout the project
to make necessary updates and throughout the project if you stumble across something new, like creating a new function. 

Onboarding for Awesome Inc has been great. I am really enjoying learning alongside my classmates and our instructors have been available for
late night questons/huddles in Slack while working on projects and troubleshooting which helps a ***TON*** 🔥. My classmates, even though
it's a remote bootcamp, have been great at collaborating 👨‍💻🧑‍💻👩‍💻 and boucning ideas off each other. This kind of positive collaboration and open communication
helped a lot of the students start on the right footing with JavaScript and complete our final project for week 2 which was an alarm clock. 
Demo day was great, because while we all worked together on this project, we all arrived at the answer in different methods. 

I must admit though,being alone after learning sessions and reading documentation/watching videos is hard to do sometimes. There are so many distractions learning at home.
I can hear my wife and daughter playing and having fun upstairs while I want to rip my hair out over a missing semicolon. I want to go upstairs to join them.
My computer I code on is the *same* computer I use to play games on 🎮. It can be tempting at times to pick up that controller when JavaScript
is overwhelming me and get lost in a game. **BUT** I am here to learn, and I understand being a programmer means having a commitment to being
a lifelong learner with the popular technologies constantly being created. I have already grown so much in a matter of two weeks. More importantly, I am blessed with the time and encouragement my wife
continiously provides to help me make this career change and land a dream job. Cheers to my fellow classmates and anyone else pushing through something
difficult! 🥂
